* minimum viable product(web)
	* As a user,
		* I can log in as a user on the web
		* I can cultivate multiple habits
			* create/remove/archive
		* I can check in the time with form to record what I done
		* I can check in multiple times
		* I can look back on the past year in the main graph
		* I can look back on the previous years in the main graph

* Advanced product(web)
	* I can put the habit into different categories
	* on the last day of the week, I can check how much time I spent on a habit in the past week
		* Do retrospection on the summary

* Advanced product(mobile)
	* As a user,
		* I can log in to different devices(web/mobile) for quick check in and synchronize the records
		* I can set/get notification to remind myself to do a habit on specific time
		* I can make the application as the widget of the screen and show the important habit to cultivate


## Technical considerations
* Backend: NodeJS with Typescript
* Frontend: ReactJS
* Mobile(not decided yet): swift or ReactNative

## Time estimation(TBD)
